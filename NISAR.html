 <h1>NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR)</h1><h3>
 NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory being jointly developed by NASA and ISRO. NISAR will map the entire globe in 12 days and provide spatially and temporally consistent data for understanding changes in Earth’s ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, ground water and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides. NISAR. It carries L and S dual band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which operates with Sweep SAR technique to achieve large swath with high resolution data. The SAR payloads mounted on Integrated Radar Instrument Structure (IRIS) and the spacecraft bus are together called an observatory. Jet Propulsion Laboratories and ISRO are realizing the observatory which shall not only meet the respective national needs but also will feed the science community with data encouraging studies related to surface deformation measurements through repeat-pass InSAR technique.

 <h1>MISSION PHASE</h1><h3>
 LAUNCH PHASE

The NISAR Observatory will be launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre(SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota on the southeast coast of the Indian peninsula, on the GSLV expendable launch vehicle contributed by ISRO. The target launch readiness date is January 2024. The launch sequence encompasses the time interval that takes the observatory from the ground, encapsulated in the launch vehicle fairing, to after separation, and ends with the completion of solar array deployment and the observatory in an Earth-pointed attitude and in two-way communication with the ground. The launch sequence is a critical event.

COMMISSIONING PHASE

The first 90 days after launch will be dedicated to commissioning, or in-orbit checkout (IOC), the objective of which is to prepare the observatory for science operations. Commissioning is divided into sub-phases of initial checkout (ISRO engineering systems and JPL engineering payload checkout), spacecraft checkout and instrument checkout. Philosophically, the sub-phases are designed as a step-by-step build up in capability to full observatory operations, beginning with the physical deployment of all deployable parts (notably the boom and radar antenna, but not including the solar arrays which are deployed during launch phase), checking out the engineering systems, turning on the radars and testing them independently and then conducting joint tests with both radars operating.

SCIENCE OPERATIONS PHASE

The science operations phase begins at the end of commissioning and extends for three years and contains all data collection required to achieve the L1 science objectives. During this phase, the science orbit will be maintained via regular maneuvers, scheduled to avoid or minimize conﬂicts with science observations. Extensive calibration and validation (CalVal) activities will take place throughout the first 5 months, with yearly updates of 1-month duration. The observation plan for both L- and S-band instruments, along with engineering activities (e.g., maneuvers, parameter updates, etc.), will be generated pre-launch via frequent coordination between JPL and ISRO. This plan is called the reference mission; the science observations alone within that reference mission is called the reference observation plan (ROP). The schedule of science observations will be driven by a variety of inputs, including L- and S-band target maps, radar mode tables, and spacecraft and ground-station constraints and capabilities. This schedule will be determined by JPL’s mission planning team, and the project will endeavour to ﬂy the reference mission, which includes these science observations exactly as planned pre-launch (accommodating for small timing changes based on the actual orbit).</font>

 <h1>Payloads along with their major capability of scientific investigation.</h1><h3>
 Lander payloads: Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.

Rover payloads: Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.</font></section>
